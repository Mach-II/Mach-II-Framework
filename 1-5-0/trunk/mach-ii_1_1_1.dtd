		maxEvents - the maximum number of events to process for a single request
		eventVariable - the name of the request parameter (form or url) that will define the event
		applicationRoot - the path to the application's folder relative to the web-server root (i.e. '/SampleApp')
		argumentsPrecedence - form | url : which to favor for conflicting request parameters
