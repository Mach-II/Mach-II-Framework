Fixed Defects
------------------------------------------------

* HTMLHeadElement and HTTPHeader callbacks failed to be removed from EventContext
This defect can cause strange problems when using nested cache blocks such as
an event-handler with a cache block that calls a subroutine with a cache block.

This defect affected Mach-II 1.6.0 and 1.6.1. It has been fixed in the 1.8 release.

* Method checking fails when extending a logger due to failure to walk inheritance tree
For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/303
(2009-05-23 peterfarrell)

* View context throws an ambiguous exception appending view content on to a complex event-arg
We now assert the target contentArg/Key is a simple value and throw a friendly 
exception if it is not.

 * BuildUrl() and related methods orders args randomly
Fixed so all args are ordered alpha-numeric which provides consistent URLs for 
search engines. This is especially important for SES URLs.

Improvements / Enhancements
------------------------------------------------
* View-Loaders
View loaders allow a developers to load views based on convention such as 
using an ANT-style path matching pattern.

(2008-11-15 peterfarrell) 

* EnvironmentProperty
Implemented a way to manage the deployment environment of Mach-II applications. This 
feature allows developers to setup properties specific to a particular environment 
and to drive other features (such as caching and logging) to change their behavior 
based on the environment in which the application is deployed.

(various dates peterfarrell)

* Toolkit enhancements
- AntPathMatcher.cfc 
- Assert.cfc
- SimplePatternMatcher.cfc

For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc-trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/wiki/MachII1.8SpecificationToolkitEnhancements
(various dates peterfarrell)

* Added buildUnescapedUrl() and buildUnescapedUrlToModule() to ViewContext
buildUrl() and buildUrlToModule() returned urls with escaped entities which
made it impossible to use the returned urls in JS or other situations where
unescaped urls are required.

For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc-trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/178
(2008-11-17 peterfarrell)

* Event-arg command accepts complex XML values (struct / array)

For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/293
(2009-05-20 peterfarrell)

* Full email configuration support for EmailLogger
Improved email configuration support. Additional parameters for 
username, password, charset, spoolenable and timeout.

* EmaiLogger only send emails when a specific log level is tripped

https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/326
(2009-06-24 peterfarrell)

* Many small performance improvements
- Removed repeated method calls to resources and conditionals that 
  evaluated the same in loop iterations.
- Changes some Java objects to be more "static" in nature instead
  of being instantiated in each method body repeatedly.
