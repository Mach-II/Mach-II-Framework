Thanks to Brian Hendel for suggesting this improvement.

http://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/793
(2011-06-07 peterfarrell)

so we could easily add in plugins to other projects like Mura.

For more info see:
http://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/790
(2011-06-01 peterfarrell)

* Added Event object to the EventArgsInvoker

providing a patch.

For more info see:

* Added try/catch around configureable property deconfigure()
If a developer replaces a configurable property with another
datatype, the framework will throw an exception saying deconfigure
failed.  This is not a bug because developers really should not
be doing this, however we added a fix so this does not happen.

For more info see:
http://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/720
(2010-12-21 peterfarrell)

* AppKey in bootstrapper causes unexpected behavior
This is an user reported improvement over what we fixed in 1.6.

For more info see:
http://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/29
(2010-12-20 peterfarrell)

* Improved XML DTD validation order

We now validate against the DTD (when the declared in the bootstrapper) before trying
to parse an XML configuration file.  This improves the exception handling when a
configuration file XML syntax is incorrect.

For more info see:
http://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/733
(2010-12-07 peterfarrell)

* Throw exception when any configurable property CFC is overrided by another during load

For more info see:
http://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/730
(2010-12-01 peterfarrell)

* Improved performance by using getFileInfo() instead of cfdirectory action='list'

For more info see:
http://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/729
(2010-11-16 peterfarrell)

* Improved performance of ViewContext
This improvement can reduce the number of method calls when building urls.

For more info see:
http://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/728
(2010-11-15 peterfarrell)

* Add ability to remove an route via the UrlRoutesProperty

For more info see:
http://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/668
(2010-09-29 peterfarrell)

endpoints and also only one rewrite file is now generated.
(2010-09-29 peterfarrell)

For more info see:
http://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/712
(2010-09-23 peterfarrell)

* Form custom tag library has complete unit test suite
(2010-09-20 peterfarrell)

* Changed CacheStats over to use AtomicInteger when present (Java 1.5+). 

For more info see:
http://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/121
(2010-09-12 kurtwiersma)

* Refactor PluginManager findPluginPoints() to use new Introspector.cfc

For more information see:
https://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/665
(2010-09-12 peterfarrell)

* Added removeCacheStrategy() method to CacheStrategyManager

For more information see:
https://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/548
(2010-09-12 peterfarrell)

* Migrate dashboard license to GPL

For more information see:
https://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/704
(2010-09-04 peterfarrell)

* Added property type shortcuts

For more information see:
https://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/696
(2010-08-21 peterfarrell)

* Switch to java.lang.StringBuffer for performance in form tag library "group" tags

Large test case sets show up to a 33% performance improvement for options, radiogroup
and checkboxgroup form library tags.  Small test case sets show no degradation or
improvement so this affects larger sets to iterate over.

For more information see:
https://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/632
(2010-04-17 peterfarrell)

* Reduced generated whitespace and improved performance of checkboxgroup and radiogroup 
form tags. We have reduced the amount of whitespace the custom tag generates and improved
the performance of the tag by approximately 1,100% - 1,500% in our test cases.

For more information see:
https://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/529
https://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/530
(2010-02-02 peterfarrell)

* Improved logging messages in CacheManager

For more information see:
https://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/554
(2010-03-10 peterfarrell)

* Refactored how cache strategies are wired into cache handlers
This change resulted in a 3.8% performance improvement on a test application.
Performance improvement is directly related to the number of cache handlers
that are implemented in an application.
