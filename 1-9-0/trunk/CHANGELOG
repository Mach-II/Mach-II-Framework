https://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/696
(2010-08-21 peterfarrell)

* Switch to java.lang.StringBuffer for performance in form tag library "group" tags

Large test case sets show up to a 33% performance improvement for options, radiogroup
and checkboxgroup form library tags.  Small test case sets show no degradation or
improvement so this affects larger sets to iterate over.

For more information see:
https://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/632
(2010-04-17 peterfarrell)

* Reduced generated whitespace and improved performance of checkboxgroup and radiogroup 
form tags. We have reduced the amount of whitespace the custom tag generates and improved
the performance of the tag by approximately 1,100% - 1,500% in our test cases.

https://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/529

For more information see:
https://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/554
(2010-03-10 peterfarrell)

* Refactored how cache strategies are wired into cache handlers
This change resulted in a 3.8% performance improvement on a test application.
Performance improvement is directly related to the number of cache handlers
that are implemented in an application.
