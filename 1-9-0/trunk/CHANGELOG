Improvements / Enhancements
------------------------------------------------
* Add support for threading on Railo

This adds support for multi-threading for message-subscribers
on the Railo engine.

For more information see:

(2010-09-02 peterfarrell)


* Add support for threading on OpenBD

This adds support for multi-threading for message-subscribers
on the OpenBD engine.

For more information see:
https://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/112
(2010-09-02 peterfarrell)

* Add file extension to MIME-type conversion in accept attribute in uploadFile()

The accept argument for uploadFile() will now convert file extensions (like
.jpg) to MIME types for you automatically.

Internal Framework Improvements / Enhancements / Other Changes
------------------------------------------------

* Added property type shortcuts

For more information see:
https://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/696
(2010-08-21 peterfarrell)

* Switch to java.lang.StringBuffer for performance in form tag library "group" tags

Large test case sets show up to a 33% performance improvement for options, radiogroup
and checkboxgroup form library tags.  Small test case sets show no degradation or
improvement so this affects larger sets to iterate over.

For more information see:
https://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/632
(2010-04-17 peterfarrell)

* Reduced generated whitespace and improved performance of checkboxgroup and radiogroup 
form tags. We have reduced the amount of whitespace the custom tag generates and improved
the performance of the tag by approximately 1,100% - 1,500% in our test cases.

* Improved logging messages in CacheManager

For more information see:
https://trac.mach-ii.com/machii/ticket/554
(2010-03-10 peterfarrell)

* Refactored how cache strategies are wired into cache handlers
This change resulted in a 3.8% performance improvement on a test application.
Performance improvement is directly related to the number of cache handlers
that are implemented in an application.
