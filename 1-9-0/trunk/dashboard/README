Mach-II Dashboard is a module to assist in developing Mach-II 
web-applications.  Current functionality of the dashboard:

 - Basic authentication (login page)
 - Reload base application or individual modules
 - Reload base ColdSpring bean factory or individual child factories
 - Reload individual listeners, plugins, filters or properties
 - Manage logging
 - Manage caching including charts of logging statistics
 - Recent exception snapshots for easy debugging
 - Basic server and application configuration information
 - JVM memory usage including charts of memory usage 

The dashboard is designed to be run as a Mach-II module and thus 
*CANNOT* be run as a stand-alone Mach-II application. The Dashboard
requires Mach-II 1.8.0 or higher.

------------------------------------------------
1.	Download the dashboard code from http://www.mach-ii.com.

2.	Unzip the dashboard to your web root*. 

	a.	For example, on Windows the default web root is [DRIVE]:\Inetpub\wwwroot, 
		or if you are using your CFML server's built-in web server, your web root is 
		likely [DRIVE]:\CFusionMX\wwwroot.  If you are on a Unix system, your web 
		root will vary.

	b.	The end result of this step is that you should have the directory MachIIDashboard 
		(no hyphen) in your web root.  Inside this directory you will find the  
		dashboard files.

	c.	If you wish to place the core Mach-II Dashboard files in a location that is 
		different from your webroot, just create a mapping called "MachIIDashboard" 
		in the CFML administrator / control panel that points this mapping to the 
		location where you placed the dashboard files.

3.	Add the dashboard as a module in your Mach-II application configuration file and 
	set the "password" property in the override XML section:

	<modules>
		<module name="dashboard" file="/MachII/dashboard/config/mach-ii_dashboard.xml">
			<mach-ii>
				<properties>
					<property name="password" value="PLACE YOUR PASSWORD HERE" />
				</properties>
			</mach-ii>
		</module>
	</modules>

4.	Reload your Mach-II application and navigate to:

	http://www.example.com/index.cfm?event=dashboard:info.index
	
	(You may have to modify this url if you use a different event parameter 
	other than "event" or using SES URLs)

Note: *If you are using virtual hosts, you will need to unzip to the root of your
website domain. 

----
Optional Configuration Properties
----

There is are few optional configuration properties that can be added to change
the behavior of the Dashboard at runtime.

* "enableLogin" Property
This property allows you to disable the login page. By default, this is set to true
if you do not specify this property.  You can disable the login page by setting
a property in the override XML for the module like this:

	<modules>
		<module name="dashboard" file="/MachII/dashboard/config/mach-ii_dashboard.xml">
			<mach-ii>
				<properties>
					<property name="password" value="PLACE YOUR PASSWORD HERE" />
					<property name="enableLogin" value="false" />
				</properties>
			</mach-ii>
		</module>
	</modules> 

However, this could potentially be a large security whole in your application if your
application is deployed to production in this manner.  You can enable the login page 
by environment group or explicit environment name. The following example disables the 
login page for all environments that belong to the "local" and "development" environment 
groups and an explicitly enables the login page for an environment named "fooBar". If your 
application is deployed to an environment that does not match any of the environment listed, 
the login page will be *enabled* by default as this provides the most secure option.

	<modules>
		<module name="dashboard" file="/MachII/dashboard/config/mach-ii_dashboard.xml">
			<mach-ii>
				<properties>
					<property name="password" value="PLACE YOUR PASSWORD HERE" />
					<property name="enableLogin">
						<struct>
							<key name="group:local,development" value="false"/>
							<key name="fooBar" value="false"/>
						</struct>
					</property>
				</properties>
			</mach-ii>
		</module>
	</modules> 

Note that environment groups use the "group:" syntax in the key name. This can contain a 
list of environment groups.  Also, explicit environments can be defined as a list as well.
Environment value resolution is always performed by explicit environment name, then environment
group and finally the default value (in this case "true") if no environment resolution can be
found. 

* "enableDashboardExceptionLogging" Property

In some circumstances you do not want to enable the exception logger that comes bundled
with the Dashboard.  You can disable the logger by setting a property in the override
XML for the module like this:

	<modules>
		<module name="dashboard" file="/MachII/dashboard/config/mach-ii_dashboard.xml">
			<mach-ii>
				<properties>
					<property name="password" value="PLACE YOUR PASSWORD HERE" />
					<property name="enableDashboardExceptionLogging" value="false"/>
				</properties>
			</mach-ii>
		</module>
	</modules>

By default, the logger is enabled so you must explicitly disable the logger by using
the above property in the override XML for the module.

You can enable or disable the logger by environment group or explicit environment name. 
The following example disables the logger for all environments that belong to the "production"
environment group and an explicitly disables the logger for an environment named "fooBar".  
If your application is deployed to an environment that does not match any of the environments 
listed, the logger will be *enabled* by default.

	<modules>
		<module name="dashboard" file="/MachII/dashboard/config/mach-ii_dashboard.xml">
			<mach-ii>
				<properties>
					<property name="password" value="PLACE YOUR PASSWORD HERE" />
					<property name="enableDashboardExceptionLogging">
						<struct>
							<key name="group:local,development" value="false"/>
							<key name="fooBar" value="true"/>
						</struct>
					</property>
				</properties>
			</mach-ii>
		</module>
	</modules>
	
* "logoutPromptTimeout" Property

In some circumstances you may want the Dashboard to auto-logout somebody after a certain
amount of time with no interaction has passed.  Due to the AJAX calls involved, an user
is basically logged in indefinitely. By default, users are auto-logged after 30 minutes
if the "enableLogin" is true. This property takes a number of minutes.

	<modules>
		<module name="dashboard" file="/MachII/dashboard/config/mach-ii_dashboard.xml">
			<mach-ii>
				<properties>
					<property name="password" value="PLACE YOUR PASSWORD HERE" />
					<property name="logoutPromptTimeout" value="30"/>
				</properties>
			</mach-ii>
		</module>
	</modules>

You can enable or disable the auto-logout timeout by environment group or explicit environment name. 
The following example disables the timeout for all environments that belong to the "production"
environment group and an explicitly disables the timeout for an environment named "fooBar".  
If your application is deployed to an environment that does not match any of the environments 
listed, the timeout will be *30* (minutes) by default.

	<modules>
		<module name="dashboard" file="/MachII/dashboard/config/mach-ii_dashboard.xml">
			<mach-ii>
				<properties>
					<property name="password" value="PLACE YOUR PASSWORD HERE" />
					<property name="logoutPromptTimeout">
						<struct>
							<key name="group:local,development" value="false"/>
							<key name="fooBar" value="true"/>
						</struct>
					</property>
				</properties>
			</mach-ii>
		</module>
	</modules>
	
* "chartProvider" Property

This property allows you to switch charting providers from "cfcharts" to "googlecharts". This property
by default is set to "cfchart" (unless the application is deployed to Google App Engine).

	<modules>
		<module name="dashboard" file="/MachII/dashboard/config/mach-ii_dashboard.xml">
			<mach-ii>
				<properties>
					<property name="password" value="PLACE YOUR PASSWORD HERE" />
					<property name="chartProvider" value="googlecharts" />
				</properties>
			</mach-ii>
		</module>
	</modules>
	
* "loginIPs" Property

In some circumstances you want to restrict the IPs or IP range that can even get to the
login page of the Dashboard. You can enabled this feature by setting a property in the override
XML for the module like this:

	<modules>
		<module name="dashboard" file="/MachII/dashboard/config/mach-ii_dashboard.xml">
			<mach-ii>
				<properties>
					<property name="password" value="PLACE YOUR PASSWORD HERE" />
					<property name="loginIPs" value="127.0.0.1,192.168.15.[2-255]"/>
				</properties>
			</mach-ii>
		</module>
	</modules>
